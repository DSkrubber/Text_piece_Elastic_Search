### Text_piece_finder

---
Save and load text pieces as jsons with FastAPI server and ElasticSearch.
To run services in containers use:

    docker-compose up -d

To send json to ElasticSearch and save text piece or to load saved pieces from ElasticSearch storage use **[Interactive API docs](https://localhost:5000/docs)** (SWAGGER).

There are 3 presets for text pieces to save via PUT method:
- First normal example - with unique
  * uuid _id (autogenerated), 
  * timestamp (autogenerated), 
  * text, 
  * type (title), 
  * page_number, 
  * document_name.
- Second normal example - with all fields of First example, except for:
  * different _id,
  * different type (paragraph)
  * page_number, 
  * document_name.
- Third example. While it is possible to add only pdf files and type of either "title" or "paragraph", this example causes exceptions for that fields and text piece won't be added to ElasticSearch storage.

To search pieces use POST with json query data. There are 4 exaples of search queries in **[Interactive API docs](https://localhost:5000/docs)**:
- Query to find 2 text pieces (search for word "functionality" which is in both pieces)'
- Query to find 1 text piece (search for both word "functionality" and type "paragraph" that only gets piece with *_id = "12345..."*),
- Query that tries to find page *-10* that is obviously not exists, so returns no matches,
- Query with no predefined parameters that will return all text pieces.
